Hi👋🏻, I’m **Bhavik Arora**. I’m someone who loves building, modifying, and experimenting with tech—especially electronics, gaming hardware, and DIY projects. I enjoy taking things apart, understanding how they work, and turning simple devices into something more advanced. Whether it’s customizing a steering wheel, coding, or fixing gadgets, I like learning new skills and improving things with my own ideas. I’m always curious, creative, and ready to try out something new.
