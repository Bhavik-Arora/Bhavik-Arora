Hi, I’m Bhavik — a developer who loves creating clean, simple, and clever projects.

I enjoy building with automation, robotics, and AI, and I’m always experimenting with new ideas.

I use GitHub as my space to learn, ship projects, and document my journey as I grow.


Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my work! 🚀
